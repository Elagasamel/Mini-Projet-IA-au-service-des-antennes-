# Mini Project: AI Applied to Antenna Performance Evaluation

## 📡 Project Context

As part of its regulatory missions, the **National Frequency Agency**  
(**ANFR in France** and **ANF in Tunisia**) ensures compliance with regulatory limits related to exposure to electromagnetic waves. To achieve this, the agency defines and regularly updates a **measurement protocol** that adapts to technological advancements.

This protocol covers all radioelectric emissions in the frequency range from **9 kHz to 300 GHz**.

---

## 📏 Measurement Protocol Overview

In 2018, two protocol versions were successively applied.  
The first step of the measurement process for frequencies above **100 kHz** involves selecting one of the following measurement approaches:

### Case A – Broadband Exposure Measurement
- Provides an overall evaluation of exposure across all sources and frequencies
- Uses a **broadband probe**
- Allows rapid assessment of global electromagnetic exposure levels

### Case B – Frequency-Selective Exposure Measurement
- Always performed **after Case A**
- Provides detailed field values per source, frequency, or frequency sub-band
- Uses a **portable spectrum analyzer**
- Enables precise identification of contributing sources

---

## ⚠️ Regulatory Threshold

If the exposure level measured under **Case A** exceeds the **attention threshold of 6 V/m**, performing a **Case B evaluation becomes mandatory** according to the protocol.
