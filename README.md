# Simple and Configured Kubernetes Deployments

## ☸️ Project Overview

The term **“cluster”** refers to a functional Kubernetes deployment.  
A Kubernetes cluster consists of two main components: the **control plane** and the **worker nodes** (compute machines).

Each node runs its own **Linux® environment** and can be either a **physical or virtual machine**.  
Nodes are responsible for running **pods**, which are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes and are composed of one or more containers.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the basic concepts and architecture of **Kubernetes** and **Minikube**
- Interact efficiently with **pods**, including debugging and troubleshooting
- Create Kubernetes deployments:
  - With YAML configuration files
  - Without YAML files (using command-line instructions)

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Kubernetes (Minikube)**
- **Nginx**
- **MongoDB**

---

## 🚀 Key Learning Outcomes

- Kubernetes cluster and node architecture
